1.1

- Added compact-alignment-to-annotation-counts mode
  - Make it possible to process multiple alignment files in one run of the mode.
  - Added support for group comparisons. Group statistics are now computed
    and written to a summary file (see --comparison --stats and --groups
    options). The following statistics have been implemented: T-Test and
    fold-change across RPKMs in the comparison groups, Benjamini-Hochberg
    FDR adjustment for t-test P-value and Bonferroni correction for t-test
    P-value. Average RPKM in each group.

- Fix a bug where data matching chromosome "chr1" was excluded from wiggle
  tracks created from Goby count data.  (Mantis issue #1349)
