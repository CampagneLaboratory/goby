development
 - New mode compare-sequence-variations will identify sequence variations that differ between
   groups of samples. This mode requires sorted/indexed alignments as input.
 - SamToCompact mode now populates the read quality scores for sequence variations (toQuality field).
 - Update picard/samtools to version 1.25
 - In the mode "alignment-to-annotation-counts" the "--eval" options supports
   a new value "counts" which will output a format specifically designed
   for use with R's DESeq and notably for the R script geneDESeqAnalysis.R
   which is used with GobyWeb.
 - Fix bug in extract sequence variations for SAM format, where matches on the
   reverse strand got a read-index larger than one from the correct value.
 - By default, don't use "counts" in DiffExp as it is a specialized output for preparing for DESeq
 - API interface for ReadsToWeightsMode
 - LastToCompactMode wasn't writing target lengths. Fixed.
 - Read TMH in Python using Gzip
 - Fixed Python utilies so -o actually writes to a file
1.7
 - Extended fasta-to-compact and compact-to-fasta to handle paired end runs. See new command
   line arguments --paired-end and pair-indicator arguments in fasta-to-compact and
   --pair-output argument in compact-to-fasta.
 - Draft support for paired sequence runs. The compact file format is extended to store
   sequence, sequence length and quality scores for the paired run. This extension makes
   it possible to store both paired end runs in a single compact file. This should help
   keep the data together.
 - Implemented translation back and from Solexa quality score encoding in fasta-to-compact
   and compact-to-fasta. Thanks to Cock PJA et al NAR 2010 for the clear description of the
   Solexa base quality scores.
 - The sort mode now supports reading only a slice of an input alignment (see options
   --start-position and --end-position).
 - Refactored CompactAlignmentToAnnotationCountsMode to use IterateAlignments (provides
   large speed ups when working with sorted/indexed alignments and selecting a subset of
   reference sequences for DE).
 - IterateAlignments now takes advantage of the skipTo method when the alignment is sorted
   and indexed. This provides large performance improvements when one needs to access data
   for only a few reference sequences in an alignments. All the modes that use
   IterateAlignments benefit, including display-sequence-variations, and
   sequence-variation-stats.
 - Index alignments that are sorted upon writing. The skipTo method leverages the index
   to provide fast semi-random access to entries by genomic location. This feature is used
   by the IGV Goby plugin, which requires Goby 1.7+.
 - Concatenate alignment now produces sorted alignments if all the input alignments
   are sorted.
 - Added a mode to sort alignment by reference sequence and then by position
   on the reference sequence.
 - Support to estimate read weights described in Hansen KD et al NAR 2010.
   See http://campagnelab.org/software/goby/tutorials/estimate-heptamer-weights/
   In contrast to the initial publication, Goby supports using the weights to
   reweight annotation counts and transcript counts.
 - Support to estimate GC content weights for reads and to reweight raw counts to
   remove the dependence of counts on GC read content.
 - Preliminary support for barcoded reads (barcodes in the sequence), see new
   mode decode-barcodes (and tutorial online at
   http://campagnelab.org/software/goby/tutorials/handling-barcoded-reads/).
 - alignment-to-*-counts: New --eval argument allows to specify which statistics
   to evaluate when comparing samples.
 - alignment-to-*-counts: New eval options 'samples' will write a column per sample
   for RPKM, log2(RPKM) and raw counts. RPKM and log2(RPKM) are written once per sample
   and global normalization method.
 - Reduce memory requirements when concatenating many alignments. A change
   introduced in 1.6 caused more memory than needed to be allocated for each
   split of an alignment (as much as the number of reads in the file that
   was split). Each split now uses only as much memory as needed to keep
   query lengths for the split.
 - Dramatically improved performance for differential expression tests with millions of
   differentially expressed elements (e.g., exon+gene+other). The code previously
   incorrectly grew internal arrays from zero to the number of new DE element described
   in the annotation file.

 Changes that impact the compact alignment format:
 - The compact file format is extended to store sequence, sequence length and quality scores
   for the paired run. This extension makes it possible to store both paired end runs in a
   single compact file. This should help keep the data together.
 - Moved query lengths from header to alignment entries. This scales much
   better when processing large alignment files (generated from more than
   a few hundred million reads).
 - The optional 'sorted' attribute in header indicates if an alignment has been sorted.

1.6
 - First draft of the Goby Python API and demonstration tools (see
   directory python).
 - Fix bug where compact file stats mode reported that a compact alignment
   had query identifiers but actually did not
 - Added within-group-variability mode. This mode estimates Fisher P-values
   between pairs of samples taken from a group of homogeneous samples.
   Summary statistics such as average p-value, or minimum p-value are
   reported for each gene in each pair considered.
 - Update JRI.jar to version 0.8-4 which now works properly with 64-bit
   Windows.
 - Update commons-lang to version 2.5.
 - Optimized DE type storage.
 - Fixed a race condition in CompactAlignmentToAnnotationCountsMode.java
   when running in parallel by moving .reserve() out of the for loop.
 - Renamed DifferentialExpression.ElementTypes enum to ElementType
 - Fixed a bug in the DifferentialExpressionCalculator which reset
   ElementType for a value from the actual value to OTHER (in occurred
   in CompactAlignmentToAnnotationCountsMode). Now once ElementTypes
   is set for a label it cannot be changed.
 - CompactFileStatsMode now supports an optional -o to write the output
   to a file. If not specified the output will be written to stdout.
 - Reformat reads now preserve read indices from the input file.
   This is necessary when using concat alignment with
   --adjust-query-indices false

1.5
 - Added a mode to calculate counts and perform differential expression
   analysis for transcript runs (alignment-to-transcript-counts).
   Transcript runs are performed against a cDNA library. They find matches
   through through exon-exon junctions represented in the input cDNA
   library. They are a faster alternative to mapping the genome and
   exon-exon boundaries separately. Disadvantage is that these searches
   will only map to transcripts represented in the input library.

 - Changes to fasta-to-compact mode:
   - Add parallel processing in fasta-to-compact mode. Use the --parallel
     flag to activate.
   - Will now only regenerate compact-reads that do not
     exist, or are older than the input file.

 - Added a mode to write a read set to text format (set-to-text). The output
   will show the multiplicity of each query index.  ReadSets can be
   efficiently created with tally-reads as before.

 - Changes to CompactAlignmentToAnnotationCountsMode
   - Added new option --write-annotation-counts boolean, defaults to
     true. If set to false the annotation counts intermediate files
     will not be written.
   - Lines where "average count group *" values are ALL NaN or <= 0 will
     not be written.  This makes it so lines that don't add anything to
     the output are just omitted.
   - Added new option --omit-non-informative-columns, defaults to false.
     If set to true, columns in which all of the data is non-informative
     (values are ALL NaN or <= 0)  will be omitted.
   - Support for alternative global normalization methods. We currently
     provide an implementation of the upper quartile normalization method
     by Bullard et al (BUQ) and the normalization method provided in
     Goby 1.4 (CAC, normalize by the number of alignment record in a sample)
     See the --normalization-methods argument. New normalization methods
     can be used with Goby by creating an implementation of the
     edu.cornell.med.icb.goby.stats.NormalizationMethod interface,
     and adding a jar on the classpath that defines a ServiceProvider
     (see build.xml goby-jar target for an example of how this is done).
     When several normalization methods are given as an argument
     to --normalization-methods Goby will produce derived statistics
     for each normalization method and append them as new columns in
     the summary stats output. This makes it easy to compare alternative
     normalization methods on the same dataset.

 - Added support for sequence variations:
   - Changed the compact alignment format to support recording sequence
     variations.
   - The new mode display-sequence-variations provides text output of
     sequence variations in several formats.
   - The new mode sequence-variation-stats will print statistics about
     sequence variations found in a set of alignments.

 - Added support for quality scores:
   - Changed fasta-to-compact and compact-to-fasta to read and write with
     the Sanger or Illumina quality encoding.
   - Modified aligners to indicate which format they require (bwa needs
     fastq format, lastag fasta format, lastal fastq format). This will
     need extensive testing as some of these changes can affect gobyweb.
     We use the FASTQ-SANGER encoding to communicate with lastal.
     We don't yet support the Solexa quality score encoding (it is a bit
     obsolete anyway).

   Please note that the output format in compact-to-fasta now defaults to
   Fasta format.  This format has no quality scores, and consequently, we
   now never write quality scores when Fasta is requested. The aligners
   that need quality scores must request FASTQ format explicitly.

   See also:
     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format

     http://last.cbrc.jp/last/doc/last-manual.txt (look for FASTQ-SANGER)

 - Changes to the Compact format:
   - Store target/reference sequence lengths in the alignment header. This
     information is helpful when calculating statistics such as RPKMs
     (transcript-level searches).
   - Store constant query lengths as one integer. Goby 1.4.1 stored one
     length for each read. This can become very memory consuming when the
     number of reads is very large. This change saves memory and storage.

1.4.1
 - Added a mode to write a read set to text format (set-to-text). The
   output will show the multiplicity of each query index.  ReadSets can
   be efficiently created with tally-reads as before.

1.4
 - Last aligner (http://last.cbrc.jp/) is now supported "out of the box".
   Tested against version last-96.  Support for the enhanced version
   "lastag" still exists.
 - Alignment-to-annotation-counts mode now computes a p-value using R
   (if available on the host)
 - Update to protobuf 2.3.0 (http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/)
 - Default extension for files written in Wiggle Track Format is now ".wig"
   for easier integration with the Integrative Genomics Viewer
   (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/).
   Similarly, the default extension for BedGraph Track Format files is
   now ".bed".

1.3
 - New "counts-to-bedgraph" mode which is similar to "counts-to-wiggle" but
   writes the data in "bedgraph" format, which is another format the
   Genome Browser accepts.
 - New mode "version" to write the jar's version number to stdout

 - counts-to-wiggle mode:
   - Write at most one entry per resolution-sized window of data (averaging
     the data in that window)
   - Don't write data past the end of the size of the chromosome (which
     is possible with resolution > 1)

 - compact-alignment-to-annotation-counts mode:
   - Fixed problem with BH FDR adjustment caused by NaN p-values.
   - ChiSquare test p-values are now correctly reported.
   - Adjusted P-values (Bonferroni and BH) are set to 1.0 if they would be
     larger than 1.
   - Added magnitude of fold change to group comparison tsv output.

1.2
 - compact-alignment-to-annotation-counts mode:
   - Added chi square test statistic and associated FDR adjusted stat.
     Chi-square statistics support multi-group comparisons.
   - Added the --parallel option to speed up computations on multiple core
     machines.

1.1
 - compact-alignment-to-annotation-counts mode:
   - Make it possible to process multiple alignment files in one run of
     the mode.
   - Added support for group comparisons. Group statistics are now computed
     and written to a summary file (see --comparison --stats and --groups
     options). The following statistics have been implemented: T-Test and
     fold-change across RPKMs in the comparison groups, Benjamini-Hochberg
     FDR adjustment for t-test P-value and Bonferroni correction for t-test
     P-value. Average RPKM in each group.

- Fix a bug where data matching chromosome "chr1" was excluded from wiggle
  tracks created from Goby count data.  (Mantis issue #1349)

1.0
- First public release.
