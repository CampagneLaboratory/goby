development

 - New "counts-to-bedgraph" mode which is similar to "counts-to-wiggle" but writes the
   data in "bedgraph" format, which is another format the Genome Browser accepts.
 - New mode "version" to write the jar's version number to stdout

 counts-to-wiggle mode:
  - Write at most one entry per resolution-sized window of data (averaging the data in that window)
  - Not write data past the end of the size of the chromosome (which is possible with resolution > 1)
   
 compact-alignment-to-annotation-counts mode:
 - Fixed problem with BH FDR adjustment caused by NaN p-values.
 - ChiSquare test p-values are now correctly reported.
 - Adjusted P-values (Bonferroni and BH) are set to 1.0 if they would be larger than 1.
 - Added magnitude of fold change to group comparison tsv output.

1.2
 compact-alignment-to-annotation-counts mode:
  - Added chi square test statistic and associated FDR adjusted stat. Chi-square statistics support multi-group comparisons.
  - Added the --parallel option to speed up computations on multiple core machines.
  
1.1

 compact-alignment-to-annotation-counts mode:
  - Make it possible to process multiple alignment files in one run of the mode.
  - Added support for group comparisons. Group statistics are now computed
    and written to a summary file (see --comparison --stats and --groups
    options). The following statistics have been implemented: T-Test and
    fold-change across RPKMs in the comparison groups, Benjamini-Hochberg
    FDR adjustment for t-test P-value and Bonferroni correction for t-test
    P-value. Average RPKM in each group.

- Fix a bug where data matching chromosome "chr1" was excluded from wiggle
  tracks created from Goby count data.  (Mantis issue #1349)

1.0

- First release.
