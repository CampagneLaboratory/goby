Goby is a next-gen data management framework designed to facilitate
the implementation of efficient data analysis pipelines. Goby provides
very efficient file formats to store next-generation sequencing data
and intermediary analysis results. In our benchmarks, these files are
from 2 to 5 times smaller than an equivalent BAM file (compressed
binary format of SAM).  Goby also provides utilities that implement
common next-gen data computations. See http://goby.campagnelab.org/
for information about the Goby project.
